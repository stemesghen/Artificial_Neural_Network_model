#  Design Matrix and Surrogate Modeling with Polynomial Regression

This project focuses on constructing surrogate models using polynomial regression techniques. The code demonstrates how to build a design matrix for polynomial basis functions and apply regression modeling to approximate a target function.

## Project Objectives

- Generate a design matrix based on polynomial basis functions.
- Implement polynomial regression to build a surrogate model.
- Visualize training data, model predictions, and residuals.
- Analyze the effect of polynomial degree on model performance.
- Evaluate the model using both training and test data.

## Key Features

- Manual construction of the design matrix using polynomial basis terms.
- Support for evaluating model accuracy on both training and test datasets.
- Residual error visualization to assess model fit.
- Flexible choice of polynomial degree to explore underfitting vs. overfitting.

## Files Included

- `Artificial_Neural_Network_model.ipynb`: Main notebook with code for model construction, evaluation, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn` (optional for model comparison)
